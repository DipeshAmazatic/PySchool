# The transpose of a matrix M, denoted MT, is formed by interchanging the rows and columns of M. 
# That is, a mxn matrix is transformed into a nxm matrix. [MT]ij = [M]ji. Write a function that 
# returns the transpose of a matrix.

def transpose(matrix):


print(transpose(M))
print(transpose([[1, 2]]))
